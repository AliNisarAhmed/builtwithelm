# [Built with Elm](https://builtwithelm.co/)

A collection of web applications built with Elm.

It showcases the awesome work the Elm community is doing and serves as a rich
source of examples for those who are new to the language.

## Submissions

Simply submit a PR with your info added to the beginning of the array in
`data/projects.json` and add a screenshot in `data/images`. Ensure that the
screenshot is **1000px x 800px** and is **optimized** for the web. If your
project is open source, please fill in your repository URL. Otherwise, just
leave it as `null`.

## History

The project was originally built by [lukewestby](https://github.com/lukewestby).
Luke wanted to create a place for people to have their open source work
recognized and for newcomers to the language to have a rich source of examples.

It was then maintained by [prikhi](https://github.com/prikhi) as an
[elm-community](https://github.com/elm-community) project for some time before
active development waned.

In 2021, I started showing interest in the project and contributed a number of
significant improvements which led to me taking over the project.
